This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the bachelor thesis titled "Modulation Techniques for Inverter Control in Electric Vehicles." The primary objective of this research is to investigate and compare different modulation techniques, including Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM), Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM), Discontinuous Pulse Width Modulation (DPWM), and Generalized Discontinuous Pulse Width Modulation. The thesis aims to analyze the impact of each modulation technique on the output waveform and switching losses in power electronic systems for electric vehicle propulsion.
Collaboration with Valeo Egypt Company enriches this research project by providing access to real-world data, practical insights, and industry expertise. The repository contains various sections, including 'data' for storing sample data collected during experiments, 'code' for code snippets and scripts utilized in waveform analysis and switching loss calculations, 'report' for the final thesis report, and 'resources' for additional references and related documents.
To use this repository, clone it to your local machine using the provided command and explore the relevant directories for data, code, and resources. The code and data can be utilized to analyze the output waveform and calculate switching losses associated with each modulation technique. For a comprehensive understanding of the research findings and conclusions, refer to the final report available in the 'report' directory.
